INTRODUCTION\\n\\nA random graph @1# is a collection of points, or vertices,\\nwith lines, or edges, connecting pairs of them at random\\n@Fig. 1~a!#. The study of random graphs has a long history.\\nStarting with the inﬂuential work of Erdo¨s and Re´nyi in the\\n1950s and 1960s @2–4#, random graph theory has developed\\ninto one of the mainstays of modern discrete mathematics,\\nand has produced a prodigious number of results, many of\\nthem highly ingenious, describing statistical properties of\\ngraphs, such as distributions of component sizes, existence\\nand size of a giant component, and typical vertex-vertex dis-\\ntances.\\n\\nIn almost all of these studies the assumption has been\\nmade that the presence or absence of an edge between two\\nvertices is independent of the presence or absence of any\\nother edge, so that each edge may be considered to be\\npresent with independent probability p. If there are N verti-\\nces in a graph, and each is connected to an average of z\\nedges, then it is trivial to show that p5z/(N21), which for\\nlarge N is usually approximated by z/N. The number of\\nedges connected to any particular vertex is called the degree\\nk of that vertex, and has a probability distribution p k given\\nby\\n\\np k5S N\\n\\nk\\n\\nD p k~12p!N2k. z ke 2z\\n\\nk!\\n\\n,\\n\\n~1!\\n\\nworks of various types, particularly in epidemiology. The\\npassage of a disease through a community depends strongly\\non the pattern of contacts between those infected with the\\ndisease and those susceptible to it. This pattern can be de-\\npicted as a network, with individuals represented by vertices\\nand contacts capable of transmitting the disease by edges. A\\nlarge class of epidemiological models known as susceptible/\\ninfectious/recovered models @5–7# makes frequent use of the\\nso-called fully mixed approximation, which is the assump-\\ntion that contacts are random and uncorrelated, i.e., they\\nform a random graph.\\n\\nRandom graphs however turn out to have severe short-\\ncomings as models of such real-world phenomena. Although\\nit is difﬁcult to determine experimentally the structure of the\\nnetwork of contacts by which a disease is spread @8#, studies\\nhave been performed of other social networks such as net-\\nworks of friendships within a variety of communities @9–11#,\\nnetworks of telephone calls @12,13#, airline timetables @14#,\\nand the power grid @15#, as well as networks in physical or\\n\\nwhere the second equality becomes exact in the limit of large\\nN. This distribution we recognize as the Poisson distribution:\\nthe ordinary random graph has a Poisson distribution of ver-\\ntex degrees, a point which turns out to be crucial, as we now\\nexplain.\\n\\nRandom graphs are not merely a mathematical toy; they\\nhave been employed extensively as models of real-world net-\\n\\nFIG. 1. ~a!

It is found @13,14#\\nthat the distribution of vertex degrees in many of these net-\\nworks is measurably different from a Poisson distribution—\\noften wildly different—and this strongly suggests, as has\\nbeen emphasized elsewhere @22#, that there are features of\\nsuch networks that we would miss if we were to approximate\\nthem by an ordinary ~Poisson! random graph.\\n\\nAnother very widely studied network is the internet,\\nwhose structure has attracted an exceptional amount of scru-\\ntiny, academic and otherwise, following its meteoric rise to\\npublic visibility starting in 1993. Pages on the world-wide\\nweb may be thought of as the vertices of a graph and the\\nhyperlinks between them as edges. Empirical studies @23–\\n26# have shown that this graph has a distribution of vertex\\ndegree which is heavily right skewed and possesses a fat\\n~power law! tail with an exponent between 22 and 23.\\n~The underlying physical structure of the internet also has a\\ndegree distribution of this type @27#.! This distribution is very\\nfar from Poisson, and therefore we would expect that a\\nsimple random graph would give a very poor approximation\\nof the structural properties of the web. However, the web\\ndiffers from a random graph in another way also: it is di-\\nrected. Links on the web lead from one page to another in\\nonly one direction @see Fig. 1~b!#. As discussed by Broder\\net al. @26#, this has a signiﬁcant practical effect on the typical\\naccessibility of one page from another, and this effect also\\nwill not be captured by a simple ~undirected! random graph\\nmodel.\\n\\nA further class of networks that has attracted scrutiny is\\nthe class of collaboration networks. Examples of such net-\\nworks include the boards of directors of companies @28–31#,\\nco-ownership networks of companies @32#, and collabora-\\ntions of scientists @33–37# and movie actors @15#. As well as\\nhaving strongly non-Poisson degree distributions @14,36#,\\nthese networks have a bipartite structure; there are two dis-\\ntinct kinds of vertices on the graph with links running only\\nbetween vertices of unlike kinds @38#—see Fig. 2. In the case\\nof movie actors, for example, the two types of vertices are\\nmovies and actors, and the network can be represented as a\\ngraph with edges running between each movie and the actors\\nthat appear in it. Researchers have also considered the pro-\\njection of this graph onto the unipartite space of actors only,\\nalso called a one-mode network @38#. In such a projection\\ntwo actors are considered connected if they have appeared in\\na movie together. The construction of the one-mode network\\nhowever involves discarding some of the information con-\\ntained in the original bipartite network, and for this reason it\\nis more desirable to model collaboration networks using the\\nfull bipartite structure.\\n\\nGiven the high current level of interest in the structure of\\nmany of the graphs described here @39#, and given their sub-\\nstantial differences from the ordinary random graphs that\\nhave been studied in the past, it would clearly be useful if we\\ncould generalize the mathematics of random graphs to non-\\nPoisson degree distributions, and to directed and bipartite\\ngraphs. In this paper we do just that, demonstrating in detail\\nhow the statistical properties of each of these graph types can\\n\\nFIG. 2.

We also\\ngive examples of the application of our theory to the model-\\ning of a number of real-world networks, including the world-\\nwide web and collaboration graphs.\\n\\nII. RANDOM GRAPHS WITH ARBITRARY\\n\\nDEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS\\n\\nIn this section we develop a formalism for calculating a\\nvariety of quantities, both local and global, on large unipar-\\ntite undirected graphs with arbitrary probability distribution\\nof the degrees of their vertices. In all respects other than their\\ndegree distribution, these graphs are assumed to be entirely\\nrandom. This means that the degrees of all vertices are inde-\\npendent identically distributed random integers drawn from a\\nspeciﬁed distribution. For a given choice of these degrees,\\nalso called the ‘‘degree sequence,’’ a graph is chosen uni-\\nformly at random from the set of all graphs with that degree\\nsequence. All properties calculated in this paper are averaged\\nover the ensemble of graphs generated in this way. In the\\nlimit of large graph size an equivalent procedure is to study\\nonly one particular degree sequence, averaging uniformly\\nover all graphs with that sequence, where the sequence is\\nchosen to approximate as closely as possible the desired\\nprobability distribution. The latter procedure can be thought\\nof as a ‘‘microcanonical ensemble’’ for random graphs,\\nwhere the former is a ‘‘canonical ensemble.’’\\n\\nSome results are already known for random graphs with\\narbitrary degree distributions: in two beautiful recent papers\\n@40,41#, Molloy and Reed have derived formulas for the po-\\nsition of the phase transition at which a giant component ﬁrst\\nappears, and the size of the giant component. ~These results\\nare calculated within the microcanonical ensemble, but apply\\n\\n026118-2\\n\\n\\x0cRANDOM GRAPHS WITH ARBITRARY DEGREE . . .\\n\\nequally to the canonical one in the large system size limit.!\\nThe formalism we present in this paper yields an alternative\\nderivation of these results and also provides a framework for\\nobtaining other quantities of interest, some of which we cal-\\nculate. In Secs. III and IV we extend our formalism to the\\ncase of directed graphs ~such as the world-wide web! and\\nbipartite graphs ~such as collaboration graphs!.\\n\\nA. Generating functions\\n\\nOur approach is based on generating functions @42#, the\\nmost fundamental of which, for our purposes, is the generat-\\ning function G 0(x) for the probability distribution of vertex\\ndegrees k. Suppose that we have a unipartite undirected\\ngraph—an acquaintance network, for example—of N verti-\\nces, with N large. We deﬁne\\n\\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 64 026118\\n\\nk np k5FS x\\n\\nD n\\n\\nG 0~x!G\\n\\nd\\ndx\\n\\n^k n&5(\\n\\nk\\n\\n.\\n\\nx51\\n\\n~6!\\n\\nPowers. If the distribution of a property k of an object is\\ngenerated by a given generating function, then the distribu-\\ntion of the total of k summed over m independent realizations\\nof the object is generated by the mth power of that generat-\\ning function. For example, if we choose m vertices at random\\nfrom a large graph, then the distribution of the sum of the\\ndegrees of those vertices is generated by @G 0(x)#m. To see\\nwhy this is so, consider the simple case of just two vertices.\\nThe square @G 0(x)#2 of the generating function for a single\\nvertex can be expanded as\\n\\n@G 0~x !#25F(\\n\\np kx kG 2\\n\\nk\\n\\n‘\\n\\nG 0~x !5 (\\n\\nk50\\n\\np kx k,\\n\\n~2!\\n\\n5(\\n\\njk\\n\\np jp kx j1k\\n\\nwhere p k is the probability that a randomly chosen vertex on\\nthe graph has degree k. The distribution p k is assumed cor-\\nrectly normalized, so that\\n\\nG 0~1!51.\\n\\n~3!\\n\\nThe same will be true of all generating functions considered\\nhere, with a few important exceptions, which we will note at\\nthe appropriate point. Because the probability distribution is\\nnormalized and positive deﬁnite, G 0(x) is also absolutely\\nconvergent for all uxu<1, and hence has no singularities in\\nthis region. All the calculations of this paper will be conﬁned\\nto the region uxu<1.\\n\\nThe function G 0(x), and indeed any probability generat-\\ning function, has a number of properties that will prove use-\\nful in subsequent developments.\\n\\nDerivatives. The probability p k is given by the kth deriva-\\n\\ntive of G 0 according to\\n\\ndx k U\\n\\nd kG 0\\n\\n.\\n\\nx50\\n\\n~4!\\n\\np k5\\n\\n1\\nk!\\n\\nThus the one function G 0(x) encapsulates all the information\\ncontained in the discrete probability distribution p k . We say\\nthat the function G 0(x) ‘‘generates’’ the probability distribu-\\ntion p k .\\n\\nMoments. The average over the probability distribution\\ngenerated by a generating function—for instance, the aver-\\nage degree z of a vertex in the case of G 0(x)—is given by\\n\\nz5^k&5(\\n\\nk\\n\\nkp k5G 0\\n\\n8~1!.\\n\\n~5!\\n\\nThus if we can calculate a generating function we can also\\ncalculate the mean of the probability distribution which it\\ngenerates. Higher moments of the distribution can be calcu-\\nlated from higher derivatives also. In general, we have\\n\\n5p 0p 0x 01~ p 0p 11p 1p 0!x 1\\n1~ p 0p 21p 1p 11p 2p 0!x 2\\n1~ p 0p 31p 1p 21p 2p 11p 3p 0!x 31(cid:149)(cid:149)(cid:149) .\\n\\n~7!\\n\\nIt is clear that the coefﬁcient of the power of x n in this\\nexpression is precisely the sum of all products p jp k such that\\nj1k5n, and hence correctly gives the probability that the\\nsum of the degrees of the two vertices will be n. It is straight-\\nforward to convince oneself that this property extends also to\\nall higher powers of the generating function.\\n\\nAll of these properties will be used in the derivations\\n\\ngiven in this paper.\\n\\nAnother quantity that will be important to us is the distri-\\nbution of the degree of the vertices that we arrive at by\\nfollowing a randomly chosen edge. Such an edge arrives at a\\nvertex with probability proportional to the degree of that\\nvertex, and the vertex therefore has a probability distribution\\nof degree proportional to kp k . The correctly normalized dis-\\ntribution is generated by\\n\\n(\\n\\nk\\n\\nkp kx k\\n\\n(\\n\\nk\\n\\nkp k\\n\\n5x\\n\\n8~x !\\n8~1!\\n\\nG 0\\nG 0\\n\\n.\\n\\n~8!\\n\\nIf we start at a randomly chosen vertex and follow each of\\nthe edges at that vertex to reach the k nearest neighbors, then\\nthe vertices arrived at each have the distribution of remaining\\noutgoing edges generated by this function, less one power of\\nx, to allow for the edge that we arrived along.

Thus, making use of the ‘‘powers’’ property\\nof the generating function described above, the generating\\nfunction for the probability distribution of the number of\\nsecond neighbors of the original vertex can be written as\\n\\nwhere k is a constant.

As we show in Sec.\\nII F, however, this conjecture is wrong.!\\n\\nB. Examples\\n\\nTo make things more concrete, we immediately introduce\\nsome examples of speciﬁc graphs to illustrate how these cal-\\nculations are carried out.\\n\\n(a) Poisson-distributed graphs. The simplest example of a\\ngraph of this type is one for which the distribution of degree\\nis binomial, or Poisson in the large N limit. This distribution\\nyields the standard random graph studied by many mathema-\\nticians and discussed in Sec. I. In this graph the probability\\np5z/N of the existence of an edge between any two vertices\\nis the same for all vertices, and G 0(x) is given by\\n\\nN S N\\n\\nD p k~12p!N2kx k5~12p1px!N5e z(x21),\\n\\nG 0~x !5 (\\n\\nk50\\n\\nk\\n\\n~12!\\nwhere the last equality applies in the limit N!‘. It is then\\ntrivial to show that the average degree of a vertex is indeed\\n8(1)5z and that the probability distribution of degree is\\nG 0\\ngiven by p k5z ke 2z/k!, which is the ordinary Poisson distri-\\nbution. Notice also that for this special case we have\\nG 1(x)5G 0(x), so that the distribution of outgoing edges at a\\nvertex is the same, regardless of whether we arrived there by\\nchoosing a vertex at random, or by following a randomly\\nchosen edge. This property, which is peculiar to the Poisson-\\ndistributed random graph, is the reason why the theory of\\nrandom graphs of this type is especially simple.\\n\\n(b) Exponentially distributed graphs.

Thus, except\\nwhen we are precisely at the phase transition where the giant\\ncomponent appears, typical component sizes are ﬁnite, and\\nthe chances of a component containing a closed loop of\\nedges goes as N 21, which is negligible in the limit of large\\nN. This means that the distribution of components generated\\nby H 1(x) can be represented graphically as in Fig. 3; each\\ncomponent is treelike in structure, consisting of the single\\nsite we reach by following our initial edge, plus any number\\n~including zero! of other treelike clusters, with the same size\\ndistribution, joined to it by single edges. If we denote by q k\\nthe probability that the initial site has k edges coming out of\\n\\nFIG. 3.

The\\nentire sum can be expressed in closed form as Eq. ~26!.\\n\\nit other than the edge we came in along, then, making use of\\nthe ‘‘powers’’ property of Sec.

Then we can ﬁnd the probability that\\na randomly chosen vertex belongs to a component of size s\\nby taking the sth derivative of H 0. In practice, unfortunately,\\nthis is usually impossible; Equation ~26! is a complicated and\\nfrequently transcendental equation, which rarely has a\\nknown solution. On the other hand, we note that the coefﬁ-\\ncient of x s in the Taylor expansion of H 1(x) ~and therefore\\nalso the sth derivative! are given exactly by only s11 itera-\\ntions of Eq. ~27!, starting with H 151, so that the distribution\\ngenerated by H 0(x) can be calculated exactly to ﬁnite order\\nin ﬁnite time.

Failing this, an approximate solution\\ncan be found by numerical iteration and the distribution of\\ncluster sizes calculated from Eq. ~4! by numerical differen-\\ntiation.

First, the\\nconditions used to derive it are only an approximation; the\\nexact answer depends on the detailed structure of the graph.\\nSecond, it assumes that all vertices are reachable from a\\nrandomly chosen starting vertex. In general however this will\\nnot be true. For graphs with no giant component it is cer-\\ntainly not true and Eq. ~54! is meaningless. Even when there\\nis a giant component, however, it is usually not the case that\\nit ﬁlls the entire graph. A better approximation to l may\\ntherefore be given by replacing N in Eq. ~54! by NS, where\\nS is the fraction of the graph occupied by the giant compo-\\nnent, as in Sec. II D.\\n\\nSuch shortcomings notwithstanding, there are a number of\\n\\nremarkable features of Eq. ~54!.\\n\\n~1! It shows that the average vertex-vertex distance for all\\nrandom graphs, regardless of degree distribution, should\\nscale logarithmically with size N, according to l 5A\\n1B ln N, where A and B are constants. This result is of\\ncourse well known for a number of special cases.\\n\\n~2! It shows that the average distance, which is a global\\nproperty, can be calculated from a knowledge only of the\\naverage numbers of ﬁrst- and second-nearest neighbors,\\nwhich are local properties. It would be possible therefore to\\nmeasure these numbers empirically by purely local measure-\\nments on a graph such as an acquaintance network and from\\nthem to determine the expected average distance between\\nvertices. For some networks at least, this gives a surprisingly\\ngood estimate of the true average distance @37#.\\n\\n~3! It shows that only the average numbers of ﬁrst- and\\nsecond-nearest neighbors are important to the calculation of\\naverage distances, and thus that two random graphs with\\ncompletely different distributions of vertex degrees, but the\\nsame values of z 1 and z 2, will have the same average dis-\\ntances.\\n\\nFor the case of the purely theoretical example graphs we\\ndiscussed earlier, we cannot make an empirical measurement\\n\\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 64 026118\\n\\nof z 1 and z 2, but we can still employ Eq. ~54! to calculate l .\\nIn the case of the ordinary ~Poisson! random graph, for in-\\nstance, we ﬁnd from Eq. ~12! that z 15z, z 25z 2, and so l\\n5ln N/ln z, which is the standard result for graphs of this\\ntype @1#.

Simulation results\\n\\nAs a check on the results of this section, we have per-\\nformed extensive computer simulations of random graphs\\nwith various distributions of vertex degree. Such graphs are\\nrelatively straightforward to generate. First, we generate a set\\nof N random numbers $k i% to represent the degrees of the N\\nvertices in the graph. These may be thought of as the ‘‘stubs’’\\nof edges, emerging from their respective vertices. Then we\\nchoose pairs of these stubs at random and place edges on the\\ngraph joining them up. It is simple to see that this will gen-\\nerate all graphs with the given set of vertex degrees with\\nequal probability. The only small catch is that the sum ( ik i\\nof the degrees must be even, since each edge added to the\\ngraph must have two ends. This is not difﬁcult to contrive\\nhowever. If the set $k i% is such that the sum is odd, we\\nsimply throw it away and generate a new set.\\n\\nAs a practical matter, integers representing vertex degrees\\nwith any desired probability distribution can be generated\\nusing the transformation method if applicable, or failing that,\\na rejection or hybrid method @45#. For example, degrees\\nobeying the power-law-plus-cutoff form of Eq. ~17! can be\\ngenerated using a two-step hybrid transformation/rejection\\nmethod as follows. First, we generate random integers k\\n>1 with distribution proportional to e 2k/k using the trans-\\nformation @46#\\n\\nk5d2kln~12r!e,\\n\\n~57!\\n\\nwhere r is a random real number uniformly distributed in the\\nrange 0<r,1.

An example of a directed graph is the world-wide\\nweb, since every hyperlink between two pages on the web\\ngoes in only one direction. The web has a degree distribution\\nthat follows a power law, as discussed in Sec. I.\\n\\nDirected graphs introduce a subtlety that is not present in\\nundirected ones, and which becomes important when we ap-\\nply our generating function formalism. In a directed graph it\\nis not possible to talk about a ‘‘component’’—i.e., a group of\\nconnected vertices—because even if vertex A can be reached\\nby following ~directed! edges from vertex B, that does not\\nnecessarily mean that vertex B can be reached from vertex A.\\nThere are two correct generalizations of the idea of the com-\\nponent to a directed graph: the set of vertices that are reach-\\nable from a given vertex, and the set from which a given\\nvertex can be reached. We will refer to these as ‘‘out-\\ncomponents’’ and ‘‘in-components,’’ respectively. An in-\\ncomponent can also be thought of as those vertices reachable\\nby following edges backwards ~but not forwards! from a\\nspeciﬁed vertex. It is possible to study directed graphs by\\nallowing both forward and backward traversal of edges ~see\\nRef. @26#, for example!. In this case, however, the graph\\neffectively becomes undirected and should be treated with\\nthe formalism of Sec.

Simulation results\\n\\nWe have performed simulations of directed graphs as a\\ncheck on the results above. Generation of random directed\\ngraphs with known joint degree distribution p jk is somewhat\\nmore complicated than the generation of undirected graphs\\ndiscussed in Sec. II G. The method we use is as follows.\\nFirst, it is important to ensure that the averages of the distri-\\nbutions of in-degree and out-degree of the graph are the\\nsame, or equivalently that p jk satisﬁes Eq. ~59!. If this is not\\nthe case, at least to good approximation, then generation of\\nthe graph will be impossible. Next, we generate a set of N\\nin/out-degree pairs ( j i ,k i), one for each vertex i, according\\nto the joint distribution p jk , and calculate the sums ( i j i and\\n( ik i . These sums are required to be equal if there are to be\\nno dangling edges in the graph, but in most cases we ﬁnd\\nthat they are not. To rectify this we use a simple procedure.\\nWe choose a vertex i at random, discard the numbers ( j i ,k i)\\nfor that vertex and generate new ones from the distribution\\np jk . We repeat this procedure until the two sums are found\\nto be equal. Finally, we choose random in/out pairs of edges\\nand join them together to make a directed graph. The result-\\ning graph has the desired number of vertices and the desired\\njoint distribution of in- and out-degree.\\n\\nWe have simulated directed graphs in which the distribu-\\ntion p jk is given by a simple product of independent distri-\\nbutions of in-degree and out-degree. ~As pointed out in Sec.\\nIII A, this is not generally the case for real-world directed\\ngraphs, where in-degree and out-degree may be correlated.!\\nIn Fig. 6 we show results from simulations of graphs with\\nidentically distributed ~but independent! in-degree and out-\\ndegrees drawn from the exponential distribution, Eq. ~13!.\\nFor this distribution, solution of the critical-point equation\\n8(1)51 shows that the giant component ﬁrst appears at\\nG 1\\nkc5@ln 2#2151.4427.

However, this equation should be used with cau-\\ntion. As discussed in Sec. II F, the derivation of this formula\\nassumes that we are in a regime in which the bulk of the\\ngraph is reachable from most vertices. On a directed graph\\nhowever, this may be far from true, as appears to be the case\\nwith the world-wide web @26#.\\n\\nThe probability distribution of the numbers of vertices\\nreachable from a randomly chosen vertex in a directed\\ngraph—i.e., of the sizes of the out-components—is generated\\nby the function H 0(y)5yG 0(cid:132)H 1(y)(cid:133), where H 1(y) is a so-\\nlution of H 1(y)5yG 1(cid:132)H 1(y)(cid:133), just as before. ~A similar and\\nobvious pair of equations governs the sizes of the in-\\ncomponents.! The results for the asymptotic behavior of the\\ncomponent\\nII E generalize\\nstraightforwardly to directed graphs. The average out-\\ncomponent size for the case where there is no giant compo-\\nnent is given by Eq. ~31!, and thus the point at which a giant\\n8(1)51.\\ncomponent ﬁrst appears is given once more by G 1\\nSubstituting Eq. ~58! into this expression gives the explicit\\ncondition\\n\\nsize distribution from Sec.\\n\\n(\\n\\njk\\n\\n~2 jk2 j2k !p jk50\\n\\n~65!\\n\\nfor the ﬁrst appearance of the giant component.

The\\ngiant component can be represented using the ‘‘bow-tie’’ dia-\\ngram of Broder et al. @26#, which we depict ~in a simpliﬁed\\nform! in Fig. 5. The diagram has three parts. The strongly\\nconnected portion of the giant component, represented by the\\ncentral circle, is that portion in which every vertex can be\\nreached from every other.

BIPARTITE GRAPHS\\n\\nThe collaboration graphs of scientists, company directors,\\nand movie actors discussed in Sec. I are all examples of\\nbipartite graphs. In this section we study the theory of bipar-\\ntite graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. To be con-\\ncrete, we will speak in the language of ‘‘actors’’ and ‘‘mov-\\nies,’’ but clearly all the developments here are applicable to\\nacademic collaborations, boards of directors, or any other\\nbipartite graph structure.\\n\\nA. Generating functions and basic results\\n\\nConsider then a bipartite graph of M movies and N actors,\\nin which each actor has appeared in an average of mmovies\\nand each movie has a cast of average size n actors.

E. J. NEWMAN, S. H. STROGATZ, AND D. J. WATTS\\n\\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 64 026118\\n\\nOf course, all of these results work equally well if ‘‘ac-\\ntors’’ and ‘‘movies’’ are interchanged. One can calculate the\\naverage distance between movies in terms of common actors\\nshared, the size and distribution of connected components of\\nmovies, and so forth, using the formulas given above, with\\nonly the exchange of f 0 and f 1 for g 0 and g 1. The formula\\n~75! is, not surprisingly, invariant under this interchange, so\\nthat the position of the onset of the giant component is the\\nsame regardless of whether one is looking at actors or mov-\\nies.\\n\\nB. Clustering\\n\\nWatts and Strogatz @15# have introduced the concept of\\nclustering in social networks, also sometimes called network\\ntransitivity. Clustering refers to the increased propensity of\\npairs of people to be acquainted with one another if they\\nhave another acquaintance in common. Watts and Strogatz\\ndeﬁned a clustering coefﬁcient that measures the degree of\\nclustering on a graph. For our purposes, the deﬁnition of this\\ncoefﬁcient is\\n\\nC5\\n\\n33~number of triangles on the graph!\\n~number of connected triples of vertices!\\n\\n5\\n\\n3N n\\nN 3\\n\\n.\\n~77!\\n\\nHere ‘‘triangles’’ are trios of vertices each of which is con-\\nnected to both of the others, and ‘‘connected triples’’ are trios\\nin which at least one is connected to both the others. The\\nfactor of 3 in the numerator accounts for the fact that each\\ntriangle contributes to three connected triples of vertices, one\\nfor each of its three vertices. With this factor of 3, the value\\nof C lies strictly in the range from zero to one. In the directed\\nand undirected unipartite random graphs of Secs. II and III,\\nC is trivially zero in the limit N!‘. In the one-mode pro-\\njections of bipartite graphs, however, both the actors and the\\nmovies can be expected to have nonzero clustering. We here\\ntreat the case for actors. The case for movies is easily derived\\nby swapping f ’s and g’s.\\n\\nAn actor who has z[z 1 co-stars in total contributes\\n\\n1\\n\\n2 z(z21) connected triples to N 3, so that\\n\\nC5\\n\\nM\\nN\\n\\n-~1 !\\ng 0\\n9~1 !\\nG 0\\n\\n.\\n\\n~81!\\n\\nMaking use of Eqs. ~66!, ~67!, and ~70!, this can also be\\nwritten as\\n\\n1\\nC\\n\\n215\\n\\n~m22m1!~n22n1!2\\nm1n1~2n123n21n3! ,\\n\\n~82!\\n\\nwhere mn5( kk np k is the nth moment of the distribution of\\nnumbers of movies in which actors have appeared, and nn is\\nthe same for cast size ~number of actors in a movie!.\\n\\nC. Example\\n\\nTo give an example, consider a random bipartite graph\\nwith Poisson-distributed numbers of both movies per actor\\nand actors per movie. In this case, following the derivation\\nof Eq. ~12!, we ﬁnd that\\n\\nf 0~x !5e m(x21),\\n\\ng 0~x !5e n(x21),\\n\\nand f 1(x)5 f 0(x) and g 1(x)5g 0(x). Thus\\n\\nG 0~x !5G 1~x !5exp@m~e n(x21)21#.\\nThis implies that z 15mn and z 25(mn) 2, so that\\n\\nl 5\\n\\nln N\\nln mn\\n\\n5\\n\\nln N\\nln z\\n\\n,\\n\\n~83!\\n\\n~84!\\n\\n~85!\\n\\njust as in an ordinary Poisson-distributed random graph.\\nFrom Eq. ~74!, the average size ^s& of a connected compo-\\nnent of actors, below the phase transition, is\\n\\n^s&5\\n\\n1\\n\\n12mn,\\n\\n~86!\\n\\nwhich diverges, yielding a giant component, at mn5z51,\\nalso as in the ordinary random graph.

Collaboration networks\\n\\nIn this section we construct random bipartite graph mod-\\nels of the known collaboration networks of company direc-\\ntors @29–31#, movie actors @15#, and scientists @36#. As we\\nwill see, the random graph works well as a model of these\\nnetworks, giving good order-of-magnitude estimates of all\\nquantities investigated, and in some cases giving results of\\nstartling accuracy.\\n\\nOur ﬁrst example is the collaboration network of the\\nmembers of the boards of directors of the Fortune 1000 com-\\npanies ~the 1000 US companies with the highest revenues!.\\nThe data come from the 1999 Fortune 1000 @29–31# and in\\nfact include only 914 of the 1000, since data on the boards of\\nthe remaining 86 were not available. The data form a bipar-\\ntite graph in which one type of vertex represents the boards\\nof directors, and the other type the members of those boards,\\nwith edges connecting boards to their members. In Fig. 8 we\\nshow the frequency distribution of the numbers of boards on\\nwhich each member sits, and the numbers of members of\\neach board. As we see, the former distribution is close to\\nexponential, with the majority of directors sitting on only\\none board, while the latter is strongly peaked around ten,\\nindicating that most boards have about ten members.\\n\\nUsing these distributions, we can deﬁne generating func-\\ntions f 0(x) and g 0(x) as in Eq. ~23!, and hence ﬁnd the\\ngenerating functions G 0(x) and G 1(x) for the distributions\\nof numbers of co-workers of the directors. We have used\\nthese generating functions and Eqs. ~72! and ~81! to calculate\\nthe expected clustering coefﬁcient C and the average number\\nof co-workers z in the one-mode projection of board direc-\\ntors on a random bipartite graph with the same vertex degree\\ndistributions as the original dataset. In Table I we show the\\nresults of these calculations, along with the same quantities\\n\\n026118-13\\n\\n\\x0cM. E. J. NEWMAN, S. H. STROGATZ, AND D. J.

This is also simple to study with our\\nmodel. In Fig. 10 we show the distribution of the numbers of\\ninterlocks that each board has, along with the theoretical pre-\\ndiction from our model. As we see, the agreement between\\nempirical data and theory is signiﬁcantly worse in this case\\nthan for the distribution of co-directors.

Inset: the number of boards on\\nwhich one’s codirectors sit, as a function of the number of boards\\none sits on oneself.\\n\\nnumbers of other boards, while overestimating those with\\nintermediate numbers of interlocks. One possible explanation\\nof this is that ‘‘bigshots work with other bigshots.’’ That is,\\nthe people who sit on many boards tend to sit on those\\nboards with other people who sit on many boards. And con-\\nversely the people who sit on only one board ~which is the\\nmajority of all directors!, tend to do so with others who sit on\\nonly one board. This would tend to stretch the distribution of\\nnumbers of interlocks, just as seen in ﬁgure, producing a\\ndisproportionately high number of boards with very many or\\nvery few interlocks to others. To test this hypothesis, we\\nhave calculated, as a function of the number of boards on\\nwhich a director sits, the average number of boards on which\\neach of their co-directors sit. The results are shown in the\\ninset of Fig. 10. If these two quantities were uncorrelated, the\\nplot would be ﬂat. Instead, however, it slopes clearly up-\\nwards, indicating indeed that on the average the big shots\\nwork with other big shots. ~This idea is not new. It has been\\ndiscussed previously by a number of others—see Refs. @48#\\nand @49#, for example.!\\n\\nThe example of the boards of directors is a particularly\\ninstructive one. What it illustrates is that the cases in which\\nour random graph models agree well with real-world phe-\\nnomena are not necessarily the most interesting. Certainly it\\nis satisfying, as in Fig. 9, to have the theory agree well with\\nthe data. But probably Fig. 10 is more instructive: we have\\nlearned something about the structure of the network of the\\nboards of directors by observing the way in which the pattern\\nof board interlocks differs from the predictions of the purely\\nrandom network. Thus it is perhaps best to regard our ran-\\ndom graph as a null model—a baseline from which our ex-\\npectations about network structure should be measured. It is\\ndeviation from the random graph behavior, not agreement\\nwith it, that allows us to draw conclusions about real-world\\nnetworks.\\n\\n026118-14\\n\\n\\x0cRANDOM GRAPHS WITH ARBITRARY DEGREE . . .\\n\\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 64 026118\\n\\nWe now look at three other graphs for which our theory\\nalso works well, although again there are some noticeable\\ndeviations from the random graph predictions, indicating the\\npresence of social or other phenomena at work in the net-\\nworks.\\n\\nWe consider the graph of movie actors and the movies in\\nwhich they appear @15,50# and graphs of scientists and the\\npapers they write in physics and biomedical research @36#. In\\nTable I we show results for the clustering coefﬁcients and\\naverage coordination numbers of the one-mode projections\\nof these graphs onto the actors or scientists. As the table\\nshows, our theory gives results for these ﬁgures that are of\\nthe right general order of magnitude, but typically deviate\\nfrom the empirically measured ﬁgures by a factor of 2 or so.\\nIn the insets of Fig. 9 we show the distributions of numbers\\nof collaborators in the movie actor and physicist graphs, and\\nagain the match between theory and real data is good, but not\\nas good as with the Fortune 1000.\\n\\nThe ﬁgures for clustering and mean numbers of collabo-\\nrators are particularly revealing. The former is uniformly\\nabout twice as high in real life as our model predicts for the\\nactor and scientist networks. This shows that there is a sig-\\nniﬁcant tendency to clustering in these networks, in addition\\nto the trivial clustering one expects on account of the bipar-\\ntite structure. This may indicate, for example, that scientists\\ntend to introduce pairs of their collaborators to one another,\\nthereby encouraging clusters of collaboration. The ﬁgures for\\naverage numbers of collaborators show less deviation from\\ntheory than the clustering coefﬁcients, but nonetheless there\\nis a clear tendency for the numbers of collaborators to be\\nsmaller in the real-world data than in the models. This prob-\\nably indicates that scientists and actors collaborate repeat-\\nedly with the same people, thereby reducing their total num-\\nber of collaborators below the number that would naively be\\nexpected if we consider only the numbers of papers that they\\nwrite or movies they appear in. It would certainly be possible\\nto take effects such as these into account in a more sophisti-\\ncated model of collaboration practices.\\n\\nB. The world-wide web\\n\\nIn this section we consider the application of our theory of\\nrandom directed graphs to the modeling of the world-wide\\nweb. As we pointed out in Sec. III A, it is not at present\\npossible to make a very accurate random-graph model of the\\nweb, because to do so we need to know the joint distribution\\np jk of in-degree and out-degrees of vertices, which has not to\\nour knowledge been measured. However, we can make a\\nsimple model of the web by assuming in-degree and out-\\ndegree to be independently distributed according to their\\nknown distributions. Equivalently, we assume that the joint\\nprobability distribution factors according to p jk5p jq k .\\n\\nBroder et al. @26# give results showing that the in-degree\\nand out-degree distributions of the web are approximately\\npower law in form with exponents tin52.1 and tout52.7,\\nalthough there is some deviation from the perfect power law\\nfor small degree. In Fig. 11, we show histograms of their\\ndata with bins chosen to be of uniform width on the logarith-\\nmic scales used. ~This avoids certain systematic errors\\n\\nFIG. 11. The probability distribution of in-degree ~left panel!\\nand out-degree ~right panel! on the world-wide web, rebinned from\\nthe data of Broder et al. @26#. The solid lines are best ﬁts of the\\nform ~91!.\\n\\nknown to afﬂict linearly histogrammed data plotted on log\\nscales.! We ﬁnd both distributions to be well ﬁtted by the\\nform\\n\\np k5C~k1k 0!2t,\\n\\n~91!\\n\\nwhere the constant C is ﬁxed by the requirement of normal-\\nization, taking the value 1/z(t,k 0), were z(x,y) is the gen-\\neralized z function @47#. The constants k 0 and tare found by\\nleast-squares ﬁts, giving values of 0.58 and 3.94 for k 0, and\\n2.17 and 2.69 for t, for the in-degree and out-degree distri-\\nbutions, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the ﬁts\\nperformed by Broder et al. With these choices, the data and\\nEq. ~91! match closely ~see Fig. 11!.\\n\\nNeither the raw data nor our ﬁts to them satisfy the con-\\nstraint ~59!, that the total number of links leaving pages\\nshould equal the total number arriving at them. This is be-\\ncause the data set is not a complete picture of the web. Only\\nabout 23108 of the web’s 109 or so pages were included in\\nthe study. Within this subset, our estimate of the distribution\\nof out-degree is presumably quite accurate, but many of the\\noutgoing links will not connect to other pages within the\\nsubset studied. At the same time, no incoming links that\\noriginate outside the subset of pages studied are included,\\nbecause the data are derived from ‘‘crawls’’ in which web\\npages are found by following links from one to another. In\\nsuch a crawl one only ﬁnds links by ﬁnding the pages that\\nthey originate from. Thus our data for the incoming links is\\nquite incomplete, and we would expect the total number of\\nincoming links in the dataset to fall short of the number of\\noutgoing ones. This indeed is what we see. The totals for\\nincoming and outgoing links are approximately 2.33108 and\\n1.13109.\\n\\nThe incompleteness of the data for incoming links limits\\nthe information we can at present extract from a random\\ngraph model of the web. There are however some calcula-\\ntions that only depend on the out-degree distribution.\\n\\nGiven Eq. ~91!,\\n\\nthe generating functions for the out-\\n\\ndegree distribution take the form\\n\\n026118-15\\n\\n\\x0cM.

The corre-\\nsponding generating functions F 0 and F 1 we cannot calcu-\\nlate accurately because of the incompleteness of the data.\\nThe equality G 05G 1 ~and also F 05F 1) is a general prop-\\nerty of all directed graphs for which p jk5p jq k as above. It\\narises because in such graphs in-degree and out-degree are\\nuncorrelated, and therefore the distribution of the out-degree\\nof a vertex does not depend on whether you arrived at it by\\nchoosing a vertex at random, or by following a randomly\\nchosen edge.\\n\\nOne property of the web that we can estimate from the\\ngenerating functions for out-degree alone is the fraction S in\\nof the graph taken up by the giant strongly connected com-\\nponent plus those sites from which the giant strongly con-\\nnected component can be reached. This is given by\\n\\nS in512G 0~12S in!.\\n\\n~93!\\n\\nIn other words, 12S in is a ﬁxed point of G 0(x). Using the\\nmeasured values of k 0 and t, we ﬁnd by numerical iteration\\nthat S in50.527, or about 53%. The direct measurements of\\nthe web made by Broder et al. show that in fact about 49%\\nof the web falls in S in , in reasonable agreement with our\\ncalculation. Possibly this implies that the structure of the\\nweb is close to that of a directed random graph with a power-\\nlaw degree distribution, though it is possible also that it is\\nmerely coincidence. Other comparisons between random\\ngraph models and the web will have to wait until we have\\nmore accurate data on the joint distribution p jk of in-degree\\nand out-degree.\\n\\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nIn this paper we have studied in detail the theory of ran-\\ndom graphs with arbitrary distributions of vertex degree, in-\\n\\ncluding directed and bipartite graphs. We have shown how,\\nusing the mathematics of generating functions, one can cal-\\nculate exactly many of the statistical properties of such\\ngraphs in the limit of large numbers of vertices. Among other\\nthings, we have given explicit formulas for the position of\\nthe phase transition at which a giant component forms, the\\nsize of the giant component, the average and distribution of\\nthe sizes of the other components, the average numbers of\\nvertices a certain distance from a given vertex, the clustering\\ncoefﬁcient, and the typical vertex-vertex distance on a graph.\\nWe have given examples of the application of our theory to\\nthe modeling of collaboration graphs, which are inherently\\nbipartite, and the world-wide web, which is directed. We\\nhave shown that the random graph theory gives good order-\\nof-magnitude estimates of the properties of known collabo-\\nration graphs of business people, scientists, and movie ac-\\ntors, although there are measurable differences between\\ntheory and data that point to the presence of interesting so-\\nciological effects in these networks. For the web we are lim-\\nited in what calculations we can perform because of the lack\\nof appropriate data to determine the generating functions.\\nHowever, the calculations we can perform agree well with\\nempirical results, offering some hope that the theory will\\nprove useful once more complete data become available.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank Lada Adamic, Andrei\\nBroder, Jon Kleinberg, Cris Moore, and Herb Wilf for useful\\ncomments and suggestions, and Jerry Davis, Paul Ginsparg,\\nOleg Khovayko, David Lipman, Grigoriy Starchenko, and\\nJanet Wiener for supplying data used in this study.
